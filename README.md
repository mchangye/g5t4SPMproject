# G5T4 Software Project Management Project: Skill Based Role Portal

How do I run the SBRP?

## Getting started

1. Go to Github Desktop and open the project in Visual Studio Code (or whatever is your preffered editor).
2. We'll need to run a front-end (Vue) and a back-end (Flask) server. So we'll need to open 2 terminals.
3. In the first terminal, enter `npm install` followed by `npm run dev` after the installation succeeds. This command runs the front-end Vue server. If there are any missing libraries, install them according to the instructions given by the terminal. 
4. In the second terminal, enter `python app.py`. This command runs the back-end Flask server. If there are any missing libraries, install them according to the instructions given by the terminal.
5. Go back to the first terminal and open the link the terminal provides. If all goes well, you will be brought to the Landing page.
